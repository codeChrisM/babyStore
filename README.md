Using a project I was working on to learn react.  I found it faster to start off from a project that was underway with most of what i needed already installed so I can just get into building right away.

**Why I Chose React**
I am currently learning React as a frame work.  And at first glance on the project I figured it was going to be a very fast a straight foward build for 2 pages that are responsive.  Not requiring me to even need a frame work or anything to dynamically happen.

However, after thinking about the actual real life application I thought to myself the client is going to add and change products and their information.  In real life we would need to have a way to actually have the information customizable and scale able.

For this purposes of this test we aren't using a CMS.  But in reality there would be one or something that would be return information to the pages.  I have simulated this with dummy data.  But it is now immediately able to be now to be implemented into whatever set up we have.  

**Where is Bootstrap?**
I intentionally chose to hold off on Bootstrap and show raw HTML and CSS technical skills.  I was advised that rely to heavily on Bootstrap isn't the point.
